# Skin_Abnormality_Classifier
The purpose of this tool is to classify skin abnormalies from seven different catergories:
Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec),
basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions
(solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like
keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df), melanoma (mel), melanocytic
nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (vasc). The model was trained and
tested using the HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source 
dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. The model has
a train accuracy of ~72% and a test accuracy of ~70%.
